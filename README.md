# gradle-github-pr-checker

It's a Gradle plugin to obtain the information of a pull request on GitHub.
For example, let's say you want to run static analyzers in the continuous integration when someone sends a pull request.
However, you want to check changed files only instead of all files.
This plugin helps you by giving you the information of a pull request.

## Quick Start

TBD.

## How to contribute?

1. Create a [ticket](https://github.com/levelrin/gradle-github-pr-checker/issues).
2. Send a [pull request](https://github.com/levelrin/gradle-github-pr-checker/pulls).
Before you do that, run `./gradlew build` and make sure the build is clean.
